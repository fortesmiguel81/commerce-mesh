# ROADMAP.md

## CommerceMesh: Distributed E-Commerce Platform

### Vision
A modern, modular e-commerce platform supporting multi-tenant sellers, product catalog, orders, payments, inventory, notifications, analytics, and background processing. Built with a microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.

---

## 1. Foundation & Infrastructure

- [X] **Solution Structure**
  - Organize services under `/src/Services/`, shared libraries under `/src/BuildingBlocks/` and `/src/ServiceDefaults/`.
  - Ensure each service has its own project and clear boundaries.
- [ ] **Common Building Blocks**
  - Implement shared kernel: base entities, value objects, error/result types, domain events.
  - Set up service defaults: logging, health checks, configuration, and cross-cutting concerns.
- [ ] **DevOps & Tooling**
  - Aspire handles container orchestration for local development automatically.
  - Add Dockerfile support for non-.NET services (Java Payment Service, Node.js Notification Service).
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc.) using Aspire manifest generation.
  - Configure Aspire for cloud deployment (Azure Container Apps, Kubernetes via manifest generation).

## 2. Core Microservices

### 2.1 API Gateway / BFF (ASP.NET Core)
- [ ] Implement API Gateway project.
- [ ] Add reverse proxy/routing to backend services.
- [ ] Implement rate limiting, request logging, and auth token pass-through.
- [ ] Compose responses for web/mobile clients.

### 2.2 Auth Service (ASP.NET Core + Identity/JWT)
- [ ] Implement authentication endpoints (register, login, refresh).
- [ ] Integrate ASP.NET Core Identity or IdentityServer.
- [ ] Issue JWT tokens; validate tokens in downstream services.
- [ ] Support user roles and session management.

### 2.3 User/Profile Service (ASP.NET Core)
- [ ] CRUD for user profiles, addresses, and payment methods (tokenized).
- [ ] Integrate with Auth Service for user identity.
- [ ] Expose endpoints for profile management.

### 2.4 Catalog Service (ASP.NET Core)
- [ ] CRUD for products, categories, and search metadata.
- [ ] Integrate PostgreSQL for data storage.
- [ ] Implement admin endpoints for catalog management.
- [ ] Expose public endpoints for product search/browse.

### 2.5 Inventory Service (ASP.NET Core)
- [ ] Track SKU quantities and reservations.
- [ ] Implement endpoints for stock updates and queries.
- [ ] Integrate with Order Service for stock reservation on checkout.

### 2.6 Order Service (ASP.NET Core)
- [ ] Receive checkout requests and orchestrate order lifecycle.
- [ ] Integrate with Inventory, Payment, and Notification services.
- [ ] Implement order state machine (pending, paid, shipped, etc.).
- [ ] Expose endpoints for order history and status.

### 2.7 Payment Service (Java Spring Boot)
- [ ] Simulate payment provider adapter.
- [ ] Handle async payment callbacks/webhooks.
- [ ] Integrate with Order Service for payment status updates.
- [ ] Practice cross-language communication (REST, gRPC, or messaging).

### 2.8 Notification Service (Node.js)
- [ ] Implement email, SMS, and push notification sending.
- [ ] Integrate with Order and Auth services for event-driven notifications.
- [ ] Use NPM ecosystem for mail/SMS providers.

### 2.9 Analytics / Events Processor (ASP.NET Core Worker)
- [ ] Aggregate events from all services (orders, payments, logins, etc.).
- [ ] Store metrics for business dashboards.
- [ ] Expose API for analytics queries.

### 2.10 Background Workers (ASP.NET Core HostedService)
- [ ] Implement long-running tasks (order timeouts, retries, batch emails).
- [ ] Integrate with main services via messaging or direct calls.

## 3. Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] **Service Discovery & Configuration**
  - Use environment-based configuration and service registration.
- [ ] **Observability**
  - Centralized logging (e.g., Serilog, ELK).
  - Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry).
  - Health checks and metrics endpoints.
- [ ] **Security**
  - Secure service-to-service communication (JWT, API keys).
  - Input validation and error handling.
- [ ] **Resilience**
  - Implement retries, circuit breakers, and fallback policies.

---

## 4. Admin UI (React or Blazor)

- [ ] Implement admin dashboard for product and order management.
- [ ] Integrate with API Gateway for backend access.
- [ ] Add authentication and role-based access control.

---

## 5. Testing & Quality

- [ ] **Unit Tests** for all core logic.
- [ ] **Integration Tests** for service interactions.
- [ ] **End-to-End Tests** for critical user flows.
- [ ] **Load/Performance Testing** for key endpoints.

---

## 6. Deployment & Scaling

- [ ] Generate Aspire deployment manifests for cloud platforms.
- [ ] Deploy to Azure Container Apps or Kubernetes using Aspire-generated manifests.
- [ ] Implement blue/green or rolling deployments through cloud platform features.
- [ ] Configure horizontal scaling policies for stateless services.

---

## 7. Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for multi-tenant sellers.
- [ ] Integrate with external payment gateways.
- [ ] Add advanced search (Elasticsearch).
- [ ] Implement event sourcing or CQRS for complex domains.
- [ ] Add mobile app clients.

---

## Milestones

1. **MVP**: Auth, Catalog, Order, Inventory, Payment, API Gateway.
2. **Notifications & Analytics**: Add event-driven notifications and analytics processing.
3. **Admin UI**: Enable management of products and orders.
4. **Production Readiness**: Observability, security, resilience, and scaling.
5. **Advanced Features**: Multi-tenancy, external integrations, mobile clients.
